== Buildship Kotlin Bug

This project demonstrates an issue with Eclipse Buildship and Kotlin that causes extra items to be added to the classpath.

To reproduce:

. Checkout this project
. Ensure Java 17 the version being used in your shell
. Run `./gradlew build` to build the project so that a `build` folder existing
. Open Eclipse (Tested with Version: 2022-06 (4.24.0) Build id: 20220609-1112. Buildship 3.1.6.v20220511-1359)
. Import the existing Gradle project
. Open the "Project and External Dependencies" classpath container
. Note that `main` has been added

This issue only happens with Kotlin 1.8.20. Edit `gradle.properties` and set `kotlinVersion` to `1.8.10` and "Refresh Gradle project" to see the correct classpath.
